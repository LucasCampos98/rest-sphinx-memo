This Memo was written [history]_ to serve as quick reference for ReST and Sphinx syntax.

Sphinx itself is very well documented, but is very large and cover
many aspects, all of them  not for daily use. And the Documentation of
Rest, while being very rigorous is not of an easy access, at least at
my own taste. I use to spend a lot of time to clarify even a tiny aspect,
as the documentation is often scattered in many locations.

Moreover Sphinx seems first to be an extension of Rest, but it is not
always true and there are some difference of aims, and
incompatibilities, between Sphinx and Rest constructs.

This Memo give the constructs that I use the most often, and give
cross-references to the manuals for details.

.. [history] This Memo is a fork of a previous version of `Cristoph Reller reST Memo
   <http://aert-notes-dev.readthedocs.org/en/latest/content/rest/>`_
   it has been deeply modified and largely extended,
   as Cristoph Reller also modified his memo, they have few in common.
